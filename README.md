# Aspyro Ores

Here is my mod comporting many ores. Most of them will be original creations, but some of them will be adaptation of already existing concepts.
With them are some tools used by the mod.

A big thank you to shiroroku for the textures !

## Ores

### Aspyrium Ore

- Aspyrium Ore is an ore that can be found rarely thoughout the Overworld dimension. [WIP]
- The most common places where you can found it is under rivers. [WIP] 
- When mined, you drop a clump that must be turned into powder using a hammer (iron level or better). [WIP]
- You can mine directly the ore using the hammer to get the powder, but there is a risk to lose some. [WIP]
- The higher the level of the hammer is, the less is the risk to lose some of the mined ore. [WIP] 
- Netherite hammer can even increase the amount or dust received when mined. [WIP]
- That powder, when associated with glowstone powder, will turn into Aspyrium compound. [WIP]
- Add that compound to iron ingot into a smithing table, and you will get yourself an Aspyrium ingot ! [WIP]
- The Aspyrium ingot can be used for usual tools and weapons like sword, shovel, hoe, axe and pickaxe. [WIP]
- Using the Aspyrium ingot instead of an ordinary iron ingot in a shield increases its durability ! [WIP]
- Questions of mod compatibility ? [WIP WIP]
  - Aspyrium color code : RGB(250,215,170)
